------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

you can implement one interface with same methods in two controllers:

@RequestMapping("/oldversioncontroller/book")
public class BookOldController implements BookOperations {...}

@RequestMapping("/newversioncontroller/book")
public class BookNewController implements BookOperations {...}

If you're using Swagger annotations it's very likely that your controller
might be hard to read. Using interfaces you can pass all this annotations
to the interface and maintain readability in the controller implementation.
